# NFTin
The application will allow you to develop your NFTs and your profile. The collector's meeting mode will allow NFT owners to choose who to follow and who not to follow based on their tastes in the NFT. And the system of likes and comments tied to the NFT makes it possible to develop the rating of this NFT for its further resale. The user account itself, representing an NFT, also accumulates a rating of likes and comments and can be sold on the open market.
